## Standing rule (May 9 2026 — Ogie msg 6444, PERMANENT)

**qwen3:8b is for Skeptic adversarial verification ONLY. Never for content generation that carries Ionic Nova's name. All public-facing content = Opus only.**

qwen3 is a pattern-matching tool, not a content writer. It hallucinates when asked to create — proven by 2026-05-09 auto-cron filings ("dog-intelligence module", "1200 sats/agent saved" — fabricated). Keep it in its lane: BuzzShield Layer 4 Skeptic, where it adversarially tests a finding against pre-existing source code (no creative latitude). Never for AIBTC signal bodies, tweets, outreach copy, technical writeups, or any output bearing Buzz BD Agent / Ionic Nova attribution. Public-facing copy = Opus 4.7 in-context, always.

## Canonicalization-Consistency Doctrine (May 9 2026 — Ogie msg "17:00 UTC dYdX QED WRITEUP DECODED")

> When module A reads/writes a shared store keyed by `canonical(X)`, and module B gates writes to that store using `raw(X)` comparisons, there exists a seam where two raw inputs that canonicalize to the same value bypass the gate.

Applies to: Cosmos SDK chains, EVM (token symbol normalization), Solana (PDA seed derivation order), any system with shared state across modules.

Origin: QED dYdX oracle hijack (2026-05-06 writeup, $10K USDC bounty, $1.2M open-interest exposure, 17-month exposure window). `protocol/x/prices/keeper/market.go` duplicate-check used byte-exact equality; `slinky_adapter.AddCurrencyPairIDToStore` used `strings.ToLower` canonicalization. Two raw tickers with case-shift Unicode equivalents bypassed the dup gate, then silently overwrote canonical mapping. Fix landed 2026-03-16: `strings.EqualFold` + `store.Has(key)` guard pair.

How to apply: any time you see a string comparison gating a store write, ask "is the same string canonicalized differently elsewhere?" If yes, the gate is permeable. Trace all upstream and downstream uses of the key. Detector spec filed as #137 (cross-module canonicalization mismatch detector, depends on #129 Cosmos SDK / Go coverage).

## No-Overwrite-Guard Doctrine (May 9 2026 — Ogie msg "17:00 UTC dYdX QED WRITEUP DECODED")

> Stores representing logical mappings (`ID`, `Registry`, `Index`, `Map`) must enforce write-once or explicit-overwrite semantics. Silent `Set` is an anti-pattern when the key represents a unique identity.

Applies to: Cosmos SDK keeper KVStore.Set, EVM mapping(...) writes, Solana PDA-keyed account writes, any "registry" or "uniqueness map" pattern.

Origin: same QED dYdX writeup. `slinky_adapter.AddCurrencyPairIDToStore` performed `store.Set(key, val)` without preceding `store.Has(key)` check. Combined with the canonicalization mismatch above, an attacker overwrite of canonical mapping became reachable. Fix is the `Has(key)` guard pair.

How to apply: any time you see a `Set` on a store whose name matches `/(ID|Map|Registry|Mapping|Index)$/`, require a preceding `Has(key)` check unless the codepath has explicitly documented "this is an upsert". If unsure, file as suspect. Detector spec filed as #138 (no-overwrite-guard detector, depends on #129 Cosmos SDK / Go coverage).

(Note: directive mentioned appending these "after Weaker-Property doctrine"; that doctrine was assigned in an earlier message I never received. When Weaker-Property arrives, insert it before these two.)
