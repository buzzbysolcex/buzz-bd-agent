  4-layer token data validation cascade for Buzz BD Agent.
  Ensures every piece of data touching a business decision is
  verified by 2+ independent sources. DexScreener primary,
  with Helius, Bankr, and GeckoTerminal as fallbacks.
  Valid data = long-term business.

# Data Failover — Token Data Validation Cascade

## Principle
Every piece of data that touches a business decision MUST be verified
by at least 2 independent sources. Unverified data = no action.

## Cascade Order
```
1. DexScreener API (FREE, primary)
   ↓ 404 / timeout / incomplete
2. Helius DAS API (FREE tier, Solana on-chain)
   ↓ rate-limited / unavailable
3. Bankr API price query (FREE, 100 msg/day shared)
   ↓ rate-limited
4. GeckoTerminal API (FREE)
   ↓ ALL fail
5. FLAG as UNVERIFIED → alert Ogie → STOP pipeline
```

## Validation Rules

| Data Point | Primary | Verification | Required Match |
|------------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Contract Address | DexScreener | Helius on-chain | EXACT match |
| Token Price | DexScreener | Bankr price query | Within 5% |
| Market Cap | DexScreener | GeckoTerminal | Within 10% |
| 24h Volume | DexScreener | GeckoTerminal | Within 15% |
| LP Status | DexScreener | Helius on-chain LP | Both confirm |
| Token Existence | DexScreener | Helius getAsset | Must exist |

## Rules
- Minimum 2 sources required for VALID data
- CA mismatch between sources → REJECT TOKEN (possible scam)
- Price variance >5% → FLAG as DISCREPANCY, use DexScreener, alert Ogie
- All sources fail → UNVERIFIED, alert Ogie, do NOT score or route
- NEVER deploy a token with unverified CA
- Bankr price check: `bankr prompt "What's the price of $TOKEN on $CHAIN?"`
