## Scoring Rules (v2_8rules + 3 new)

| # | Rule | Type | What It Catches |
|---|------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | FDV Gap Penalty | Penalty | FDV/mcap divergence > 5x = inflated valuation |
| 2 | Stablecoin Exclusion | Filter | Stablecoins auto-excluded (not listing candidates) |
| 3 | Ghost Token Exclusion | Filter | No real on-chain activity = dead project |
| 4 | Contradictory Audit Hold | Hold | Conflicting security data = needs manual review |
| 5 | Security Penalty | Penalty | Flagged by Go+ Security / Token Sniffer / Honeypot.is |
| 6 | Liquidity Cross-Ref | Verify | Liquidity vs volume sanity check |
| 7 | Age Bonus | Bonus | Token age > 90 days = maturity signal |
| 8 | Volume Threshold | Filter | Minimum 24h volume required |
| 9 | GHOST_VOLUME | Penalty | Fake volume detection (wash trading patterns) |
| 10 | CTO_FLAG | Flag | Community takeover indicator (original team left) |
| 11 | VOLUME_LIQUIDITY_RATIO | Penalty | Suspicious volume/liquidity ratio > 10x |

## Score Bands

| Range | Classification | Action |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| 85-100 | HOT | BD screening pipeline activated |
| 70-84 | WARM | Monitor, potential future candidate |
| 50-69 | COLD | Low priority, log and archive |
| 0-49 | REJECTED | Auto-filtered, do not pursue |
