# Wallet Guard — Buzz BD Agent

> 3-state adapter: BLOCK / WARN / ALLOW
> Schema-frozen with AION (3 locked schemas)
> API: POST https://api.buzzbd.ai/api/guard/evaluate

## When to Use

- Before any token swap or transfer
- Evaluating unknown contracts before interaction
- Agent-to-agent transaction governance
- Protecting wallets from rug pulls, honeypots, drain attacks

## 3-State Decision Engine

| State | When | What Happens |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **BLOCK** | Score < 30 OR honeypot detected OR deployer blacklisted | Transaction rejected. Receipt logged. Alert sent to War Room. |
| **WARN** | Score 30-69 OR missing security data OR CTO_FLAG active | Transaction paused. Human approval required via Telegram. |
| **ALLOW** | Score >= 70 AND security clean AND identity verified | Transaction proceeds. Receipt logged with full audit trail. |

## Usage

### Via Claude Code
```
/guard 0x6982508145454Ce325dDbE47a25d4ec3d2311933 swap 100
```

### Via API
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.buzzbd.ai/api/guard/evaluate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token_address":"0x...","chain":"base","action":"swap","amount_usd":100}'
```

## Trust Gate Integration

Wallet Guard respects the 5-level trust system:
- Level 0 (FULL_APPROVAL): ALL transactions require Ogie's approval
- Level 1-2: BLOCK auto-rejects, WARN/ALLOW need approval
- Level 3: Only BLOCK needs approval
- Level 4 (AUTO_85): Score >= 85 auto-allows, rest need approval

Current trust level: **0 — FULL_APPROVAL** (earning autonomy)

## Security Rules

- NEVER auto-approve transactions at trust level 0
- ANY complaint → instant trust reset to Level 0
- Receipts are immutable (append-only audit table)
- Graceful fallback if AION API unreachable (defaults to WARN)
- Private keys NEVER logged, printed, committed, or transmitted
